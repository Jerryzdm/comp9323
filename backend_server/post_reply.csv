0,What is it like to study at UNSW Australia?,What is it like to study at UNSW Australia?,"I have recently finished my degree at UNSW, so I’ll tell you the following: Social Aspect: As others have stated, UNSW will have a LOT of Asian students. By rough estimation along walking the main walkway and surroundings, I’d dare say that at least 50% of UNSW is Chinese (comprising of international students, ABCs and others). If you don’t mind dealing and walking around with Asian people then this should be no problem. I have noticed that there’s quite a strong selective school culture here too. There’s a saying that for Sydney Boys/Sydney Girls High School students, attending UNSW feels exactly the same as attending school - just extend the bus ride down Anzac parade. Coming into UNSW during my first year, I didn’t feel any culture shock at UNSW because the selective school/tutoring culture was very prevalent. You would frequently see students who went tutoring with you in younger years (prep for selective tests and HSC) only to meet them at the same uni. There’s a LOT of societies at UNSW too. They range from your faculty clubs (Business Society, Actuarial Society, Mathematics Society, Engineering Society etc.), to career based clubs (UNIT, UCC, ECS, etc.) to fun based clubs (AnimeUNSW, Kpop Society, D2MG, etc.). Join them to make friends and connections that will potentially last you a life time. Not to mention that ARC membership (mostly a requirement to join clubs) is free if you’re a student of UNSW. In terms of food offerings, on campus there is Guzman Y Gomez (Mexican), Malaysian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indian and a few other offerings. Coffee carts are great and coffee at UNSW is very good quality (at least compared to abroad). If you want better eats then you can go along Anzac parade to Kingsford and you’ll find plenty of Chinese, Japanese, Malaysian, Thai eateries. Go east and you’ll see Randwick for more food options including Coles and Woolworths for shopping. For drinking and partying you have the Roundhouse and the Whitehouse. The Roundhouse got a refurbishment lately so apparently it looks nice (I haven’t been myself). Don’t forget about Whitehouse Wednesdays (cheaper alcohol after 4pm). Roundhouse parties are pretty good too from what I’ve heard (although I don’t attend them). UNSW is a lot less political overall. This means that Arc board and SRC student elections will not have much of an impact on campus life compared to USYD and other universities where student politics plays a huge impact on campus life. The most political it became was just the issue of the BSOC elections and CEVSOC elections a few years ago, and that activity is tame compared to what happens at USYD. The Campus: Tbh the university campus is quite compacted. Lots of buildings that are at least 7–8 storeys high (building up) which is necessary due to the lack of land available. However that means that getting to and from places should take no more than 10 minutes. On the other hand UNSW does have heaps of stairs if you need to walk up from lower to upper campus. The Basser steps it is. Which means walking up and down might take a toll on your energy levels but will certainly improve your fitness levels. There’s some green area (village green, village lawn, physics lawn, naked lady lawn, globe lawn, library lawn) but most of UNSW is a concrete slab. That said still a lot of Instagram-worthy sites though. You can also tell UNSW is really making bank as evident by construction of new buildings, demolitions to existing buildings so it can build new ones. You can see all the crane towers on campus too. So as you walk by there is not a single time that you cannot hear construction noises. Faculties: As a general rule, undergrad at UNSW is quite difficult of a uni (compared to universities in the US, but easier than Singapore or India). You have to work hard to obtain good grades. Passing isn’t easy for many subjects (they recently got rid of pass conceeded grades) unless if you study smart and effective. Overall, lecturers are quite decent and willing to help. Unlike the US, your tutors here are normally 2nd, 3rd year+, honours, masters or PhD students (and they are not called TAs), however there are chances you can have lecturers as tutors depending on cohort sizes. Most of them are quite willing to help. In this section I’ll only comment on the faculties I know: UNSW Business School: UNSW Engineering: UNSW CSE (Computer Science and Engineering): Administration: As Imad Hashmi stated, UNSW does feel run like a business. Everything feels very efficiently run here. Enrolment, adding details, paying fees, deferring payment using HECS, course administration, receiving results all done online and can be done yourself. However, overloading courses and approving timetable clashes need to be approved in person (the only manual thing). You can do your timetable yourself, which is a great thing since you can dictate when you come to class (if you even go) so you can deal with part time and/or full time work. I know a lot of students do this and that’s how they get a foot in the door after graduation while studying at uni at the same time. Not only that I’ve noticed UNSW administrative staff are more willing to help you and try to get your needs met (compared to other unis). You can see that they’re desperate for money but they will work for it. Not to mention that I’ve used services over the phone and I did not wait anymore than 5 minutes on the online. Speak of efficiency. Special consideration requests are usually very lenient too (compared to USYD, where it is quite uniform and strict). Job prospects out of UNSW: For one there is UNSW Careers and Employment - so use that service if you’e having trouble finding a job/internship. Other than that I know that when I attend a lot of assessment centres (another fancy word for group interview), half of the room is full of UNSW people and other familiar faces. Also note that UNSW has one of the highest employment rates of the G08 universities. Not only to mention that UNSW produces the most millionaires in Australia of all universities combined. I noticed a few of my friends decided to do startups too, so tag along with that. ",food

2,Is UNSW the MIT of Australia?,Is UNSW the MIT of Australia?,"For parochial reasons, Australian National University (ANU) has funding thrown at it by the politicians because it’s in Canberra. It would be a bit embarrassing if the nation’s capital (which is in reality a small provincial city) had a provincial university to go along with it. It’s portrayed as Australia’s #1 research University. Whether this is actually the case I could not say for sure. Over he past few years Melbourne Uni has consistently been rated the #1 university in Australia. At other times this has not been the case. From what I hear, UNSW is good but I would not call it the MIT of Australia. UNSW is basically the Sydney equivalent of Monash Uni in Melbourne. You’ll find that Australian Universities generally have a strong focus on a small number of ‘boutique’ disciplines that get all the funding and prestige. Depending on the Uni this might be in IT or biotech, or medicine or solar power (or whatever). Don’t be surprised if some of the prestigious Australian Universities actually offer some average quality courses and vice versa. ",living
3,How good is UNSW?,How good is UNSW?,"Its good, but no where near as good as its marketing depicts it. I’ve worked and studied there, but like many other universities across the world it has become a business. Large class sizes and overwhelmed teaching staff make it quite unpleasant if you’re ever looking for help with your work. In terms of a social life its quite poor too, many students i’ve met leave disappointed with the lack of engagement they’ve had socially at UNSW. Things also suggests it could get notably worse in the not too distant future. It is moving towards trimesters in 2019 to maximise their income from students, and cutting support staff in some key areas which will likely impact the student experience. They will also be moving some academics to solely teaching positions which will mean that quality academics may look to leave UNSW and go somewhere they can continue their research. It will also mean in some cases students are not being taught by academics whose teaching is informed or influenced by current research. I’m not sure why you’re asking, but if it is about potentially going to UNSW i would suggest you properly think about why you want to go there. Don’t get me wrong, it has quite a good reputation but with whats in store for the future things may change. ",living

5,How hard Is it to get into UNSW?,How hard Is it to get into UNSW?,"Actually it isn’t very hard for international students trying to study to enter UNSW. I’ve known Chinese and Arab students who used the Foundation Programme set up by UNSW to allow students to enter the courses relevant to their streams. There are Foundations in Sciences, which gets students to enter the Science-related degree streams, Foundations in Design which is more towards Architecture and Design at UNSW Art and Design, and Foundations in Art, which allows student to enter the philosophy side of the degree programme. I say that although this is a very easy and surefire way to enter uni, even if you are a local student, there is a catch: You need to maintain your GPA (or WAM) in your course and make sure you don’t fail or you’ll need to retake. IELTS is also mandatory with an 8 (Last time i checked it was 7.5 but you might as well go 8 for better reasons- also relevant if you’re applying for a Visa) and you will need your high school leaving cert to show your potential to study that course. Its really gruelling, but rewards those who dare to finish this intense course in a year’s time. I got in with my ATAR which was a 91, and i went for design. For most Australians who desire to enter UNSW, it can be tough, but through the Foundation programme and ……a hefty amount of money, you will have a surefire way to enter the university! ",living

Sometimes my favourite thing to do on the weekend was just get out of my apartment and away from my school work and just relax and wander around. ",living

With regards to the majority of courses, the quality of content and teaching is unlikely to be a distinguishing factor between the three institutions. What will probably be of more relative importance is the type of environment in which you wish to study. Each of these universities has a unique ‘character’ of its own and your student experience will be significantly influenced by the location of your institution. Some brief observations of mine: Finally, I can also say that it will be probably more difficult to find accommodation in Sydney than in Melbourne at the moment due to their respective property markets. Hope this helps. ",living

Depending on the classes you take, you will meet different people from all walks of life, but again this is all up to you to decide how you want to do it: make friends or ignore them And then, there are club activities from meetup groups, social groups, etc. If you decide not to coop up in your dorm and go out there to join the groups, you may meet people who are generally more open to talk to you! I daresay that my social life in UNSW is a bit lacking, but i met more interesting people during cross-uni activities like Uni of Sydney’s Neko Nation (its usually held there) and UTS’s Anime UTS Christmas Parties. Macquarie also has amazing student communities that are generally warm and receptive, so….maybe you can get acquainted with people from different uni’s to get varying exposures! ",living

22,Is there a rivalry between UNSW and the University of Sydney?,Is there a rivalry between UNSW and the University of Sydney?,"Minor edits incorporated Nov 5: Of course! Both are in the Sydney area, about 6-7 km apart, and both are ranked among the best universities in Australia. (The University of Sydney and UNSW are both members of the Group of Eight (Go8) - a coalition of research-intensive Australian universities.)  There are, however, marked differences between the institutions: Sydney University was founded in 1850; UNSW almost exactly 100 year later, in 1949. Sydney University prides itself on its long history, beautiful sandstone campus and the fact that it was modeled after Oxford and Cambridge. UNSW was founded post WWII to meet the growing need to have a university focused on training engineers and technology-related professionals. In contrast to the University of Sydney, UNSW is more a ""new world"" institution modeled on US research-intensive universities such as MIT. Both are outstanding universities with strong programs in teaching and research across most disciplines. Universities everywhere now compete for dwindling Government dollars, philanthropic support, the very best students and international acclaim. Given that these two outstanding institutions are separated by just a few miles, it is not surprising that they are rivals. It really can't be any other way. Note added: I was concerned that the word ""rivalry"" carried a negative connotation, but the dictionary definition does not suggest that at all: ""competition for the same objective or for superiority in the same field.""

25,"Which is better, UNSW or USyd for engineering foundation program?","Which is better, UNSW or USyd for engineering foundation program?","I completed a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical) at the University of Sydney and then did a Masters in Biomedical Engineering at UNSW. I agree with Conor O’Driscoll’s answer that Sydney in the late 1980s was quite mathematical and theoretical. I found UNSW in the early 1990s more practical with assignments having more real-life applications. The Sydney degree was quite generalist; we looked at many different topics in Electrical Engineering. The only specialisation was in the Project work in the last year and we had to complete a 6 week industrial placement. Other universities might require greater specialisation at an earlier stage. The Sydney approach let us try out different topics and electives, which can be helpful if you are still learning about yourself and what you like to study. I feel that the Sydney course could lead to work in a Research and Development environment, while the UNSW course would be more practical for general industry. I personally found it tougher to get higher marks at Sydney, though that might have been due to being older at UNSW, and maturity of study methods would have helped. We did have very good students at University of Sydney, who scored very highly in the HSC, but you no doubt would find that is the case also at UNSW. Sydney is a lovely campus, but I liked UNSW too, and felt that their libraries were both very helpful for my work. I feel that the lecturers at UNSW were more approachable and helpful than Sydney, but things could have changed by now. We were also a smaller group in the Centre for Biomedical Engineering which could explain that. I hope this answer assists you. ",living

You'll need plenty of motivation for the long journey ahead, so consider which one feels right.

During my career I've recruited or assisted recruiting folk into many desirable corporate roles. Human Resources and decision makers in the hiring proces are abolutely looking for the best individual, and don’t consider perceived prestige of a university as a factor in hiring someone. Maybe there are some niche pockets in Australia where an employer responds to this factor, but I would avoid them at all costs. In theory, I would concede that a University's reputation in a very specific sub-specialty could be a factor to another person with detailed knowledge of that sub-specialty… But in reality, fields of knowledge change so quickly, that such reputations would change between your current choice of university and your eventual PhD completion.

46,What is the difference between computer science and software engineering at UNSW?,What is the difference between computer science and software engineering at UNSW?,"Felix made some good point but I suppose a SE perspective on the topic would also be helpful! (Assuming Felix is/was doing a CS degree). I’m currently doing Software Engineering at a University in the same state, and someone I know is doing it in UNSW. For this answer I will focus on the UNSW program. CS is more flexible with less compulsory courses, and therefore it will allow you to do more electives in CS as well as other faculties. Software Engineering, on the other hand, is much more structured. AFAIK there is 1 elective available for the first year and 1–2 at second year. For example I wanted to do a logic course next semester, but due to my SE degree requirement, I have to do database instead. The degree is more flexible in year 3 with the “gen-ed”(i.e. courses that are not in the faculty) component. So what are some of the strength of a software engineering degree? The compulsory engineering units focus on many non-technical skill. This include Team work, project management, prototyping, report writing etc. These soft skills, while sounds mundane, are essential for many software development jobs. Of course these can be learnt with the electives from CS. It is easier, however, to learn in a structure designed for these purposes. (Side note: I believe in UNSW SE compulsory is mostly team-project based, and last-semester first year project is building a working, self-navigating robot!) Another (possible) benefit is that because it is structured, employers know you must have written more than a few detailed report, participated in several team-based project, and completed an internship. This might marginally increase your employment prospect. My personal opinion: check out the compulsory courses for each degree, and if you’re sure that you wouldn’t mind doing the SE one then go for it. If you’re not too sure which area of CS you want to focus on or you want to do a minor in another area then do CS. Final word: Since the degrees are so similar, transferring between them will not be a hustle, so don’t be too worry that you’re making the wrong choice!

Indian universities are prestigious because of poor seat to applicants ratio which makes their selection procedure tough and attract best minds of the country. Just google global rankings of these universities. Foreign universities you mentioned are nearly in top 50. Only few IITs and IISc make to top 200 list. However, there could be some road blocks in studying abroad which may push you to aim towards Indian universities. All the best!! I don't know why some people are having trouble accepting my answer. I admit Indian institutions are great, IISc, IISERs, IIIT hyderabad, all of them have quality research going on. However, the question is comparing them with University of South Wales. I know being Indians, it's difficult to accept but IITs do not come any closer to MIT, Stanford, Hardvard…. I have friends in IITs, and seniors pursuing MS abroad. And please don't comment, these rankings are not true, institutes can't be compared bla bla. Colleges can be easily compared. ",living

From my experience last year is what everyone know is when the outcomes start to be delivered and emailed to some student. I was being told that university will give all the applicants their ranking (confidential to the applicant - so we never know what is our ranking). So what they do is offer the scholarship to the first rank first then give some time for her/him to response. If there is no response/rejection, it will go to second, then third, and so on... In my case last year, I got my scholarship on January. It's quite late though, because some of my friends already got it on December. None For the scholarship itself there are 3 types: IPRS (from government), UIPA (from UNSW), and TFS (in which your supervisor pay your stipend). The ranking system from I know is go for the IPRS one (maybe UIPA - I never know about UIPA ranking). Below the IPRS is the TFS one. If your ranking happen to be on the TFS part, your supervisor will be asked are he/she willing for to pay tour stipend. If they say no, you will not get TFS.

Then for science ( bear in mind that as a UQ student my opinion is obviously bias), UQ is a well know research university. Especially in the scientific field. However, I couldn’t simply state what was the most challenging course, as what I found a challenging Physics course is completely irrelevant to a biology student and vice versa.

It is a very difficult university to get to by public transport and and the drive to the place and finding parking can be impossible. I am a Sydney graduate and PhD and so naturally my opinion of Uni of Melbourne is that they are a bunch of unspeakable arseholes. I have not had any positive experiences to change my mind.

The airport and areas around UNSW should be safe enough. I am guessing your flight will arrive during the day as no flights are permitted to land before 6 am. If you use Google Maps and select the option for Public Transport, you will find the relevant buses and routes that you could take. It also provides you with an estimate of the time of travel. Ordinary public buses don’t have storage racks for your bags but this does not mean you can’t hop onto the bus with your bags. It simply depends on how strong you are and how must time and effort you want to put into lugging your luggage around. Please bear in mind that if the Google Maps option provided is a Train plus a Bus, you will incur an Airport Surcharge (Station Access Fee) of between A$5.60 to A$13.80 plus the normal train fare and then you would incur another far for the Bus to UNSW.

Some students will then use their electives to load up on courses that require the least amount of time in class or have a high pass rate. My recommended path is to follow your interests in computer science topics. For example, I didn't know what topic I was interested in the most so I enrolled in a wide breadth of courses ranging from networks to AI to advanced/extended algorithms to compression.

I attended some of the open days, and that answered a lot of my questions about UNSW.

I’m typing this on my iPad, as I work on my COMP assignment, so my hands are starting to cramp up… I’d strongly advise you to visit an open day at UNSW, even if it’s just for their talk on what engineering is about at UNSW and what they offer (which is a lot).

There is no doubt regarding the quality of education in the US even today. But, if you consider job prospects after course completion, the scene will be quite different. On the other hand, in Australia it is hard to get a full time position in the field of one's expertise without a PR visa. Most employers will prefer candidates having PR visa. That being said, you can still find a job of your choice if you are ready to put in your effort and be proactive. But then, same can be said about US.

I have done a full time MBA at MBS and the quality of education was simply mind-blowing. I have heard similar experiences about AGSM. Now it comes down to where would you like to live after your MBA, as you will get maximum network exposure in the city you do your MBA. As Debarun mentioned, your professional networks play a big part in your post MBA employment. So I would also recommend you to start networking from the first day. Both MBS and AGSM have great Alumni networks. Visa/residency status is the other big factor for employment post MBA. In some cases you do get visa sponsorship for work, but there are limited opportunities with that option and the new visa rules have come in action recently. I will recommend you to sort your plan for visa first and then start an MBA. Also, both MBS and AGSM are globally recognised b-schools with global alumni networks as well.

170,How is the Bachelor’s of Construction Management in Bond University compared to UNSW?,How is the Bachelor’s of Construction Management in Bond University compared to UNSW?,"Thanks for the ask2answer. None Qilt is an Australian government site where the graduates of all the courses compare teaching quality, course quality, learning resources and graduate outcomes. Bond or UNSW would be a tough decision, as they are both excellent universities. Bond is a much smaller university, you’ll get more personal attention, small classes (max 12 in a tutorial). Whereas UNSW is a much bigger university, larger courses with many more students in it, probably better known than Bond, but a lot more students, and you may find it harder to access facilities there. None UNSW is probably not as structured although they will have careers support, although their position in the eastern suburbs of Sydney means that their graduate outcomes are good because they are close to Australia’s largest commercial hub. Both universities are in different locations, Bond on the Gold Coast and UNSW in Sydney. Bond is close to surf beaches, and the area is beautiful, whereas UNSW is in the middle of a huge city and unless you have lots of money you may not be able to live in the eastern suburbs close to UNSW (the eastern suburbs are the nicest and most expensive part of Sydney). UNSW has a campus that was built in the 1960s, although they have a number of new buildings to make it nicer. The Bond campus is smaller, but really beautiful. The UNSW is in a really built up area of Sydney, whereas Bond has ovals, and fresh air, and space. At Bond more of the students live on campus or nearby, and it is close knit and quite social communtiy, so probably easier to make friends there. It can be harder to make friends at a large metropolitan university like UNSW where most students don’t live on campus. Bond is considered a “rich” university as a private university, but UNSW is in a really rich area of Sydney too but not as expensive as Bond for Australian students. It’s a tough choice, as they are both really good options. Perhaps decide if you want to live in Sydney or the Gold Coast, and go from there. Good luck! ",living

Each university is aimed at a particular personality type. So the question should actually be more about what you are looking at from the university.

There will be plenty of programming opportunities for you during the course of study and many courses will require you to write a lot of code which will build up your skills in your chosen subjects. No sure what level of study you are going to do but you may have to learn new programming languages each new term. Many companies hire students for part time programming jobs as well.

If so, it’s going to be very hard for you to make that trade as a fresh-from-college hire. Apart from the logistical challenges of building connections with New York-based IB employers, there’s the almost totally prohibitive issue of securing US work authorization, which you probably can’t do right out of the gate. Now, perhaps you have US work authorization by virtue of being born to an American parent. Alternatively, you could try getting married to an American (which worked for me!), although that may not quite line up with your wider life plans. Other than by these avenues, there is pretty much no way for even the most motivated of employers to secure a US work visa for you as an entry-level hire. Other than this, the most likely avenue would involve starting out with a local investment banking employer that has a large presence in the United States. Macquarie comes to mind in this respect. There are also plenty of US banks with growing operations in Sydney, so those could represent pathways too. Once you’ve worked for at least a year in a non-US office of a firm, that organization can obtain an L-1 visa for you that enables you to work for that same organization in the US. ",living

219,"Which one is better: studying Data Science at UNSW, Computer Science at University of Sydney, or Mathematics at Australian National University?","Which one is better: studying Data Science at UNSW, Computer Science at University of Sydney, or Mathematics at Australian National University?","None Details: “I really like those 3 fields, hence I applied to different majors for all the universities. I am mostly interested at the student environment and also job offers (as an international student).” Until you are admitted to universities, you will not have the actual costs of attendance, and the fact that you have three different majors, you do not have clear cut benefits. What this means is you cannot do a cost benefit analysis to determine which university is the better economic choice. As far as job placement, job placement depends on what you accomplished in your program and cannot be predicted a priori because the number of available jobs depends on a future volatile job market. From an employment prospective, computer science has more entry level jobs than data science or mathematics. Finally, student environment is too subjective to be a deciding factor. Australian National University is located in the capital, so student experience would be different from both UNSW and University of Sydney that have access to Sydney. ",living

The course syllabus is just a framework and it depends completely on the Professor how he covers it.

UNSW has one of the best computer science programs in Australia, with many of the students getting job offers from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Dropbox and then relocating to the Bay Area. Just a note though, rankings of universities reflect reputation on research, and not in terms of undergraduate teaching quality. I’m not sure of the teaching quality and marking at SUNY Buffalo but I can confirm UNSW is very rigorous with regards to their computer science programs. I can confirm that some subjects mark not only to a bell curve but also harmonic and geometric means (which means you can get penalised harder for inconsistent performances). Not to mention that if you come from a country that is not either Australia or the United States, then you will most likely be paying full fee upfront. In that case, UNSW would be much cheaper. Not to mention that UNSW is easier to gain entry to (probably harder to exit because course is more difficult). ",living

On the ME route, IMHO, Strength of Materials and/or Fluid Mechanics is different and will broaden your knowledge of Engineering. A combo of EE and ME will most likely keep you busy in the electro-mechanical field while a combo of EE and CS may lead you in the direction of cloud and/or Data Science route.

Both Townsville and Hobart, despite weaker economies, are great lifestyle choices — I’m about to move to Townsville myself!

Do students find it possible to concentrate for the whole duration?","I am a Master of Commerce student at UNSW. When it comes to the learning format, there are two types of lectures, which are 3 hours full lecture and 3 hours full seminar/tutorial. I got courses which were 3 hours full lecture and some courses on the 3 hours full seminar format. If you have a 3 hours full lecture, that usually means the total 3 hours is divided by 1.5 hours on lecture and 1.5 hours on tutorial. During the tutorial, the lecturer will assume you have read the assigned readings and case studies for that week. Therefore, you and your team would spend that 1.5 seminar hours working and thinking on how do the concepts apply to the practice through the case studies. Most of the time, the lecturer would ask if the students require some break in between lecture and seminar, and the answer to that question is usually ‘no. let’s jump to the seminar so we can finish early’. The 3 hours full seminar/tutorial (the second type), is normally for courses that require lots of in-class activities or talking. This type of learning is really effective if the course is all about doing or solving a real project. I got some courses which were taught in this format, and they were ‘Social Entrepreneurship Practicum’, ‘Negotiating class’, and some capstone courses. These courses generally require more student activities rather than learning new concepts (because the lecturer want you to learn new concepts using the readings they gave you, and apply it in class). In conclusion, there might be a break in between 3 hours lecture format, and wether your class is 3 hours lecture or 3 hours seminar, it really depends on what you study and the level of student activities in the class. Having said so, I personally think that it is really possible to concentrate during the whole duration. In fact, many students do not want to have a break in between the lecture and seminar. I hope it helps. ",living
